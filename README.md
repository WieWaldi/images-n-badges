## Motivation
Kind of childish but it looks nice having these badges placed in websites.
By retaining these badges in a github repository I can easily include them
into my README.md files.

## Links/URLs/Credits
[shields.io](https://shields.io/) - a service for concise, consistent, and legible badges in SVG  
[naereen.github.io](https://naereen.github.io/badges/) - Markdown code for lots of small badges  
[simpleicons.org](https://simpleicons.org/) - Free SVG icons for popular brands  

## Version
The option to create releases on GitHub is pretty nice. I really do like it
since it give me easy access to all the files without git cloning the complete
repository.  

Version 0.2
